## Python Code Validation

I have used the recommended [PEP8 CI Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com) to validate all of my Python files.

Further, I used [nbqa](https://pypi.org/project/nbqa/) with flake8 to validate all python code inside my Jupyter notebooks. To do this I followed the following steps:

* Install nbqa with: `pip install nbqa`
* Run in terminal: `nbqa flake8 your_notebook.ipynb`
* Repeat the second step for each notebook and the errors and warnings will be displayed in the terminal
* See the screenshots with empty terminal output, meaning no warnings or errors found
